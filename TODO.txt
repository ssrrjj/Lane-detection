1. After gaussian thresholding, the boundries will always be detected as lane mark. Need a proper way to remove. 
   If I remove all pixels, some true mark points will also be removed. DONE

2. Some area with low intensity and density cannot be detected. How to compensate density.
3. Use detection results of previous piece to enhance current. For example, if I detect a lane 'l' in previous piece, then lane marks probably
   also appear near 'l' in current piece.
